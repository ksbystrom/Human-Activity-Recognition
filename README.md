# Human-Activity-Recogntion
This is a research project while taking Math 496 taught by Professor Ben Adcock at SFU.
The goal of this project is to implement techniques learned in class (and some new ones) to tackle a data science project.
Our work is based off of the dat set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set "from the UTI machine learning repository.
I worked on this project together with Alice Roberts.

Currently, the August 7th file is the up to date one and contains all of our code. It has no dependencies
