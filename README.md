# Human-Activity-Recogntion
The goal of this project is to implement techniques learned our data science classes (and some new ones).
Our work is based off of the dat set "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set "from the UTI machine learning repository.
I worked on this project together with Alice Roberts.

Currently, the August 8th file is the up to date one and contains all of our code. It has no dependencies
